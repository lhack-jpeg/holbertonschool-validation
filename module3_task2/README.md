# DevOps: Automate Everything to Focus on What Really Matters

## By Luke Hackett

## Learning Objectives

This project aims at showing use cases where a DevOps mindset is bringing value to a software project by automating it, which decreases the amount of manual work and increases the development speed. It focuses on why automation is useful and helps speeding a development lifecycle.

After this project, you should be able to:

-   Understand the value of automating tedious tasks
-   Define a development lifecycle
-   Automate shell-like tasks with Make, and/or shell script
-   Be aware of tools dependencies and the value of reproducing environment
-   Build static HTML website from Markdown code using Go-Hugo

## Prerequisites

-   An HTML5-compliant web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, etc.)
-   A free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/), referenced as `GitHub Handle`
-   A shell terminal with bash, zsh or ksh, including the standard Unix toolset (ls, cd, etc.)
-   [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) Make in version 3.81+
-   Git (command line) in version 2+
-   [Go Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) v0.80+

## Project State

## Workflow

The project state currently is using Github actions.

It performs the following actions:

-   Clones the repo
-   Position yourself in the correct directory and execute the command `make help` to validate that the Makefile is present and implements the help target check.

It is triggered when:

-   Each time there is new code pushed on your repository
-   Once a day

## Build Workflow

The actions performed at midnight and every time the repo is pushed is:

-   Clone the repo
-   Run setup.sh to download and install the missing packages
-   Lint the yaml and shell file
-   Make a build
-   Make a post
-   Run server and curl the website
-   Clean up the repo.

## Lifecycle

##### Planning

The team is looking to move the internal wiki on to HUGO as the team is comfortable with it.

##### Requirements

###### To run

-   An HTML5-compliant web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, etc.)

###### To Edit:

-   Your favourite IDE, emacs, vscode.

##### Product Architecture

##### Developing the Product

The program is generated uising the inbuilt functions provided by HUGO 0.80+.
The Makefile is built to GNU Make v4.3
Hugo 0.80+

##### Testing the Product

##### Deployment

## following make file use `make` <command>
